# **GARCH**

This notebook focuses on the implementation of the **GARCH family of models**, which are fundamental tools in financial econometrics for modeling and forecasting time-varying volatility in asset returns. These models are particularly useful in capturing the well-documented stylized facts of financial time series, including **volatility clustering**, **persistence**, and **asymmetry (leverage effects)**.

In this analysis, we turn our attention to the **S&P 500 Index**, a benchmark representing the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The volatility of the S&P 500 is of critical interest to investors, risk managers, and policymakers, as it reflects the market's risk sentiment and has broad implications for portfolio management and derivative pricing.

## **Objective**

Our goal is to apply and compare several models from the **ARCH/GARCH family** to model and forecast the conditional volatility of S&P 500 returns. Specifically, we will implement:

- **GARCH** (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
- **EGARCH** (Exponential GARCH) — captures asymmetries (leverage effects) in volatility
- **GJR-GARCH** — accounts for different impacts of positive and negative shocks
- **GARCH-NN** — a hybrid model combining GARCH with deep learning components for greater flexibility in capturing nonlinear patterns

## **Workflow**

### **1. Data Collection and Preprocessing**
- Load and clean the S&P 500 daily price data
- Compute returns
- Conduct preliminary visualization and stationarity checks

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize return and volatility behavior
- Inspect autocorrelations
- Conduct normality and heteroskedasticity tests

### **3. Model Estimation**
- Estimate and fit various ARCH-based models to the return series
- Analyze model parameters and perform diagnostic checks

### **4. Forecasting and Model Evaluation**
- Generate volatility forecasts
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - Out-of-sample data
  - Loss functions
  - Statistical tests

## **Conclusion**

Through this analysis, we aim to determine **which variant of the GARCH family provides the most accurate and robust volatility forecasts** for the S&P 500 index. Such insights are valuable for both academic research and practical financial applications.
