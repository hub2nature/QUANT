**GARCH
**
This notebook focuses on the implementation of the GARCH family of models, which are fundamental tools in financial econometrics for modeling and forecasting time-varying volatility in asset returns. These models are particularly useful in capturing the well-documented stylized facts of financial time series, including volatility clustering, persistence, and asymmetry (leverage effects).

In this analysis, we turn our attention to the S&P 500 Index, a benchmark representing the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The volatility of the S&P 500 is of critical interest to investors, risk managers, and policymakers, as it reflects the market's risk sentiment and has broad implications for portfolio management and derivative pricing.
**
Objective**

Our goal is to apply and compare several models from the ARCH/GARCH family to model and forecast the conditional volatility of S&P 500 returns. Specifically, we will implement:

GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)

EGARCH (Exponential GARCH) — which captures asymmetries (leverage effects) in volatility

GJR-GARCH — which accounts for different impacts of positive and negative shocks

GARCH-NN (Neural Network-enhanced GARCH) a hybrid model combining GARCH with deep learning components for greater flexibility in capturing nonlinear patterns
**
Workflow
**
Data Collection and Preprocessing
Load and clean the S&P 500 daily price data, compute returns, and conduct preliminary visualization and stationarity checks.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize return and volatility behavior, inspect autocorrelations, and conduct normality and heteroskedasticity tests.

Model Estimation
Estimate and fit various ARCH-based models to the return series, analyzing model parameters and diagnostics.

Forecasting and Model Evaluation
Generate volatility forecasts and evaluate model performance using out-of-sample data, loss functions, and statistical tests.
**
Conclusion
**
Through this analysis, we aim to determine which variant of the GARCH family provides the most accurate and robust volatility forecasts for the S&P 500 index. Such insights are valuable for both academic research and practical financial applications.
