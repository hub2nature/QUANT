GARCH

This notebook focuses on the implementation of the GARCH family of models, which are fundamental tools in financial econometrics for modeling and forecasting time-varying volatility in asset returns. These models are particularly useful in capturing the well-documented stylized facts of financial time series, including volatility clustering, persistence, and asymmetry (leverage effects).

In this analysis, we turn our attention to the S&P 500 Index, a benchmark representing the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The volatility of the S&P 500 is of critical interest to investors, risk managers, and policymakers, as it reflects the market's risk sentiment and has broad implications for portfolio management and derivative pricing.
